# Branching
There are 3 main branches to this project: Logic branch, database branch and GUI branch. All the development of code takes places in these
3 branches. Logic branch is where all the logic layer is implemented and so on. Atmost 2 people work on each branch.

Once the code is complete, tested and when everything works as intended, we then push that code to our master branch.
