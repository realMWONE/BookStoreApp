## Iteration 1

# Adding a feature

Our project simulates a bookstore system,
- Feature: Worked on searching the book by ISBN, title and author name. 
    - We divided the work amongst ourselves by assigning tasks per layer to atmost 2 people in our group.
    - Kevin made all of the presentation layer for the feature by adding search page, bar and buttons, 
      Harshal and Dawarit worked on the data layer and added a 'fake' database of the books plus book
      database management system. Matt and Animesh worked on the logic layer, which included handling 
      the data passed like book name,ISBN or author between the presentation and data layer

# SOLID
Group 11
- How? 
    - Course class can be broken down into smaller classes. Like for example, Course.java should have getters and setters within it.
      This coding strategy firstly does not perform object oriented programming
    - Secondly, This violates Single-responsibility principle as that class should only have one single responsibility of getter and setter for these local variables.
      These getters and setters should be used to perform other functions like add in other classes. Instead of having them all cramped in one class
