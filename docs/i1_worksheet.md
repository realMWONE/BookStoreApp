## Iteration 1

# Adding a feature

Our project simulates a bookstore system,
- Feature: Worked on searching the book by ISBN, title and author name. 
    - We divided the work amongst ourselves by assigning tasks per layer to atmost 2 people in our group.
    - 
- [Feature link]()
- [User Stories link]()
- [Merge requests link]()
- [Associated tests link]()
- [Merge commit link]()

TO-DO:
Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit that was used complete the feature.
Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

# Exceptional code

[Exceptional code link]()
- TODO Explanation


Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences,
provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown
in the code you are testing.

# SOLID

- How? 
    - Course class can be broken down into smaller classes. Like for example, Course.java should have getters and setters within it.
      This coding strategy firstly does not perform object oriented programming
    - Secondly, This violates Single-responsibility principle as that class should only have one single responsibility of getter and setter for these local variables.
      These getters and setters should be used to perform other functions like add in other classes. Instead of having them all cramped in one class

# Agile Planning

- Did you 'push' any features to iteration 2?(Links)
    - Yes, we have pushed certain [Features]() to iteration 2

- Did you change the description of any Features or User Stories?
    - Yes, we have changed the description of [Features]() and [User Stories]()
