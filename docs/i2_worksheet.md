    During the initial designing of the Book Detail View, Kevin created the layout dynamically, instead of creating a visual layout. 
    It was done this way because it was quick and we needed to finish it for iteration 1.
    For iteration 2, we redesigned to the layout in the visual editor, which looks better as it gives us more control.
