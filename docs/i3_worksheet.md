## Iteration 3

- What technical debt has been cleaned up
In iteration 2, we were unable to use the hsqldb as listed in the marking 
rubrics. We had a lot of problems when it came to setting up a proper environment 
for this kind of database. It is classified as a prudent deliberate debt because 
we were aware that failure to implement the database could lose us a lot of marks. 
However, we had no other choice but to deliver a working product with a fake 
database to meet a strict deadline.
