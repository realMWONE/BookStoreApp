<font face = "Verdana" size = "5">Our Vision Statement</font>
<br><br>
<font face = "Verdana" size = "2">The Bookstore App is an inventory management tool for physical bookstores that is primarily targeted to bookstore staff. The application contains a library of the bookstore’s inventory along with the books’ details such as title, author, ISBN, publisher, publishing date, genre, page count, and price, which its user can view anytime and anywhere. Its main purpose is to offer a modern and easy-to-use version of existing bookstore software that runs completely from a smartphone. This will allow managers and employees to efficiently and conveniently keep track of their inventory. Running on a smartphone allows better managing of inventory through in-app stock counts and notifications for important information. In addition, the app would also allow regular customers to quickly check the inventory before heading to the store.

<br>
The three levels of users are: management, employees, and customers. Customers have the most basic features that allow finding and viewing book information, like price and genre. They can also reserve a book for in-store pickup. Employees will have the additional ability to see the remaining stock of each book. Managers will have the ability to change prices and order more inventory.
<br><br>
Users will be able to find books by title, author name, and ISBN. This can also be expanded to include other important information in the future. Once a book is found, the user can select a book from the resulting list to see a new page containing all the details of that book.
<br><br>
A trending page will show the customer all the popular purchases and new releases in the last few weeks. Discounted items will also be shown, helping the customer find an interesting book in the shortest amount of time. Also, when looking up books, popular searches will be displayed. The goal of these features is to make the customer’s experience with the app as stress-free as possible.
<br><br>
While the app will not have online purchasing, customers can use the information provided in the “Contact Us” page to contact the bookstore staff and reserve a book for up to three days, giving them time to pick it up in person.
<br><br>
The speed and convenience of having all these features in their pocket will allow managers to better maintain their inventory and track sales. The notification feature will help prevent items from getting sold out. The user-friendly interface will help all levels of users find exactly what book they are looking for. To summarize, this app will provide a more usable and modern way of running a bookstore compared to the complex systems that only run on a desktop computer.
If successful, this application will provide swift and easy inventory management on a smartphone. Additionally, success requires an increase in customer satisfaction due to helping them find books that they enjoy. And finally, through better management and customer-friendliness, an increase in sales is expected.
